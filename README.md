# AStar --- Routing Algorithm

This program is the proposed solution to 
computing an optimal path (according to distance) from 
_Basílica de SantaMaria del Mar_ (Plaça de Santa Maria) in Barcelona 
to the _Giralda_ (Calle Mateos Gago) in Sevilla by
using the AStar algorithm. 
To this end the A* (AStar) algorithm has been implemented.
The OSM ( _Open Street Map_ ) coordinates of both end and goal positions are:
node with key (@id): 240949599 (lattitude 41.3833063º, longitude 2.1817609º) 
as the starting point in Barcelona,
while the goal node close to Giralda is identified by (@id): 195977239 
(lattitude 37.3860938º, longitude -5.9917354º).
